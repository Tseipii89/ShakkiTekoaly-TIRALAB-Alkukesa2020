# Chess AI

This is a school project where I build a chess AI. School gave me the  [TIRA chess library](https://github.com/TiraLabra/chess). The TIRA chess library gives the player a method to interact with the https://lichess.org/ webpage. The TIRA chess library itself seems to depend on [Simple chess library](https://github.com/bhlangonijr/chesslib). This Simple chess library provides the list of legal moves for the player.

This git repo is providing AI for the TIRA chess library. I provide the rules for the chess and my AI will provide the best move for a piece given a specific situation and restrictions. All the methods and classes that directly have a link to the chess rules I have written myself.
