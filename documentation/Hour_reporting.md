## Week 3

Date       | time | target |
-----------|------|--------|
2020-05-24 | 3h | TiraBot takes the movement String and updates the gameBoard |
2020-05-25 | 3h | TiraBot returns a random move. Lichess works with the bot (although bot doesn't yet know that you shouldn't sacrifice your king) |
2020-05-26 | 2h | Added different values to the pieces. The bot prefers eating opponent pieces now. Still might accidentally sacrifice king. Checkstyle down to 80 errors. |

2020-05-28 | 1h | Refactoring |
2020-05-29 | 3h | Fixing the King not in check method. There was a fool bug that was hard to recognize since my debugging doesn't work. Refactoring the code. |

## Week 4

Date       | time | target |
-----------|------|--------|
2020-05-30 | 4.5h | Making of minimax algo, it doesn't work at the moment. Have to check it later |
2020-05-31 | 5h | Making of minimax algo ready. The bot stills makes stupid moves though.|

2020-06-05 | 1.5h | Writing of implementation document, and update class diagram |

## Week 5

Date       | time | target |
-----------|------|--------|
2020-06-06 | 4h | Found the problem with MIN-MAX. It wasn't in the bot. It was the performance test. Made corrections. |
2020-06-07 | 1h | Refactoring and checkstyle down to 0 errors. |
2020-06-08 | 4h | Alpha-beta pruning implemented. Tests written and again found that performancetest class was the problem. The alpha-beta works again. Writing of testing document. |
2020-06-09 | 1h | Writing of implementation document |
2020-06-10 | 2h | Writing of issue for my fellow student. Removed unnecessary code in kingcheckclass. Still the test fails. |
2020-06-10 | 1.5h | Corrected the test failures. Tested the bot again. Now the moves are correct, but still bot makes stupid moves. It has to be something to do with the board evaluation. Also the checkstyle had ignored the datastructure -package. I added it into checkstyle. Checkstyle errors are again in 108, yay. |

## Week 6

Date       | time | target |
-----------|------|--------|
2020-06-13 | 1h | Created min, max and abs methods. Simplified code. Corrected Checkstyle down to 70 errors. Corrected the bug that errored Travis build (at least I think so) |
