# Week 4

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 3
* MIN-MAX algorith ready


## Problems
* The implementation of MIN-MAx was harder that I suspected. I'm not sure if the object-oriented approach was right on this task


## Questions
* Should I continue with object-oriented approach? I only have the alpha-beta pruning left for this algorithm. The bugs are very hard to find. I think I have been too lazy with the testing part.


## Next week
* Alpha-beta pruning done
