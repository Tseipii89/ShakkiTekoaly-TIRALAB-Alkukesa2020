# Week 4

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 3
* MIN-MAX algorith ready


## Problems
* The implementation of MIN-MAx was harder that I suspected


## Questions
* I'm not sure if there is any bugs on the MIN-MAX, but the bot makes sometimes stupid moves in my opinion (but the MIN-MAX actually goes only 2 steps forward, so it might be that it is just not enought at the moment)


## Next week
