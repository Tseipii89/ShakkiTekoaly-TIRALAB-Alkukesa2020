# Week 4

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 3
* MIN-MAX algorith ready


## Problems
* The implementation of MIN-MAx was harder that I suspected. I'm not sure if the object-oriented approach was right on this task


## Questions
* Should I continue with object-oriented approach? I only have the alpha-beta pruning left for this algorithm. The bugs are very hard to find. I think I have been too lazy with the testing part.
* I don't know if the Min-Max works correctly. The test complete nicely and min-max seems to work, but the bot makes stupid moves against the Lichess bot. I think it might be because of the fact that min-max only look 2 steps down at the moment.


## Next week
* Alpha-beta pruning done
