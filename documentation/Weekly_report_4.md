# Week 4

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 4
* MIN-MAX algorith ready
* First Performance tests done (I relied very heavily on the performance test package provided within example, probably will refactor this more if I have extra time)


## Problems
* The implementation of MIN-MAx was harder that I suspected. I'm not sure if the object-oriented approach was right on this task
* There is a problem with tiraBot. It doesn't work with Min-Max algorithm. I found this bug because TiraBot's performance time didn't even flinch if I had 1 or 10 checks down the Min-Max algo. The Min-Max algo itself does work as suspected.


## Questions
* Should I continue with object-oriented approach? I only have the alpha-beta pruning left for this algorithm. The bugs are very hard to find. I think I have been too lazy with the testing part.


## Next week
* Alpha-beta pruning done
