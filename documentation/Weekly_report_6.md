# Week 6

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 6

* Created min, max, abs and random methods.
* Implemented the methods above.
* Removed the unnecessary boolean maximize or minimize from alpha-beta and min-max methods
* Wrote user manual

## Problems

*  Again clean build caused some problems. I didn't do clean build immediately and because of this my tests didn't succeed. And due to this I just pulled my hairs again for couple of hours.
* I tried to implement the castling, but the code quickly came very ugly. I had to return back to earlier git head, and lost about 2 hours of work. I decided to only implement the castling in a way that the bot recognizes the castling made by opponent, but doesn't do castling itself.
