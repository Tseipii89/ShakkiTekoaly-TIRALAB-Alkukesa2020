# Week 5

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 5

* Checkstyle down to 0 errors.
  * Later found out that datastructure package was missing and errors went back up to 108.
* Alhpa-Beta pruning implemented
* Peer-review of my fellow student's code. He was a master coder.
* Refactoring and simplifying the code.

## Problems

* Again I thought there was a problem with the alpha-beta pruning. There wasn't. It was just I didn't notice the difference between alpha-beta and min-max on few first steps.
* The bot works and I'm quite hopeful that the job so far could get me a pass on this course. However there is very much refactoring and simplifying to do on the code side. I have listed the known updates/erros in [Implementation Document](/documentation/Implementation_Document.md)

## Questions

* Is the implementation document (toteutusdokumentti) ok?

## Next week

* Refactoring
* Creating own classes for Math.min and Math.max and Random methods
* Writing of user manual
