# Week 5

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 5
* Checkstyle down to 0 errors.
* Alhpa-Beta pruning implemented


## Problems
* Again I thought there was a problem with the alpha-beta pruning. There wasn't. It was just I didn't notice the difference between alpha-beta and min-max on few first steps.

## Questions
* Is the implementation document (toteutusdokumentti) ok?

## Next week
* Refactoring
* Creating own classes for Math.min and Math.max and Random methods
* Writing of user manual
