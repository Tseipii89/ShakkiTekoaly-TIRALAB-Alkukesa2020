# Implementation Document

**11.6.2020: Current depth of the bot is 4 steps**.

The realised architecture of the program is shown below (I didn't realise the classes create such a mess). The ready given classes from Tira chess -library are not included in the architecture picture.

## The O -analyses

The program was tested with two different algorithms. The first one was basic [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm and the second was the [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) improvement done on the Minimax.

### Minimax

The pseudocode is taken from the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) wikipedia page. 

```java
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) is
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node then
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer then
        value := −∞
        for each child of node do
            value := max(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, FALSE))
        return value
    else (* minimizing player *)
        value := +∞
        for each child of node do
            value := min(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, TRUE))
        return value
```

```java
(* Initial call *)
minimax(origin, depth, TRUE)
```

The theoretical O -time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^m) where n indicates possible moves in given situation and m indicates the nodes searched. 

### Alpha-beta pruning

The pseudocode is taken from the [Alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) wikipedia page. 

```java
function alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, maximizingPlayer) is
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node then
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer then
        value := −∞
        for each child of node do
            value := max(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, FALSE))
            α := max(α, value)
            if α ≥ β then
                break (* β cut-off *)
        return value
    else
        value := +∞
        for each child of node do
            value := min(value, alphabeta(child, depth − 1, α, β, TRUE))
            β := min(β, value)
            if β ≤ α then
                break (* α cut-off *)
        return value
```

```java
(* Initial call *)
alphabeta(origin, depth, −∞, +∞, TRUE)
```

In the best situation the theoretical O -time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^0.5 * m) where n indicates possible moves in given situation and m indicates the nodes searched. 

Alpha-beta pruning can in best situations drop half of the nodes needed to be investigated. This has a huge impact on the code performance as we will see next.

## The tested performance

The test are run in a very spesific board situation to bring focus on the difference of the run times of the different algorithms. The board layout is told on [Alpha-beta pruning section](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977).

As one can see there is significant improvement with alpha-beta pruning. The O(n^m) means that dropping half of the exponent "m" causes significant reduce in the nodes that are checked.

## Future improvements and shortages

The code was written fully with objects. Now after the implementation of the code, I think it might have been easier to do for example the game board with just matrix table, and not board -object.

### Corrected errors

* ~~When running bot on Lichess, white bishop went in the same tile with white Pawn. So again there is something wrong with the movement rules. It has something to do with KingInCheck -class, but the KingInCheck -class works on some instances.~~
  * 11.6.2020: Made KingInCheck -class simpler and corrected the tests. The encountered problem never occured since. I have no idea what caused it, but I'm hopeful it has been corrected.

### Known updates to be made and errors to correct

* The checkstyle errors are in 22.
* The scoring of board could be updated. Now the bot makes some stupid moves. I'm very sure the alpha-beta pruning works and the problem is actually the  scoring of the board.
* The KingInCheck is quite heavy and does some extra iterations. This could be optimised not to do extra iterations.
* At least in Lichess the bot knows only how to move as a white player.
* I haven't included the draw -rule of chess for the bot. Damn, I noticed this on 24.6.2020.
* I added the sideMultiplier used in the code into the Side enums. I need to replace the multiplier everywhere.
* Minimax has a stupid solution for converting Board and back to String and vice versa.
* Minimax is constantly selecting new AlphaBetaPruner objects.
* recursion won't finish if the king is eaten
* Test document needs to be filled with chapter of JUnit tests and how the bot works.
* Tests run slowly.

### Known updates to be made and errors not to be corrected

* The bot recognizes castling done by opponent and updates the board, but I haven't implemented the castling for the bot.
* I haven't added enpassant for my bot.
