# Week 2

[Hour reporting](/documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 2
* The Pawn mocement rules have been added
* Knight movement rules added
* Rook movement rules added
* Bishop movement rules added
* Checkstyle, contious integration and jacoco added

## Problems
* I have started to notice small problems, if I haven't been careful about the refactoring of the classes. The classes become un-maintable very quickly.
* Also testing is becoming increasingly important. The whole thing is keeping itself together only because of very well implemented testing.


## Questions


## Next week
* Starting the min-max algorithm and possibly alpha-beta pruning
* Checking integration testing, if that should be added now, or only after my bot is finished
