# Week 1

[Hour reporting](/Documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 1

* Project creation
* Writing of (initial) design documentation (as it will live with agile development)
* Start of coding the bot. I used TDD as the method for this.


## Problems

## Questions

* Would the TIRABot's next move method work faster if I would not create the Tile class, and would instead use 8x8 matrix to show the chess board?
* Would it be best to create some kind of HashMap system for the board to find quickly a given tile?

## Next week
