# Week 1

[Hour reporting](/Documentation/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 1

* Project creation
* Writing of (initial) design documentation (as it will live with agile development)
* Start of coding the bot. I used TDD as the method for this.

## Problems

* None so far. So far I haven't used any ready made data structures. I'm sure though that in the performance testing phase there will come multiple things that can be optimised.

## Questions

* Would the TIRABot's next move method work faster if I would not create the Tile class, and would instead use 8x8 matrix to show the chess board?
* Would it be best to create some kind of HashMap system for the board to find quickly a given tile?
* Is there any way to use Lichess as an automated testing platform? Or is the only way to use Lichess as a testing platform to manually run the program in Lichess?

## Next week

* Probably I'll have the bot returning a random move in the right format.
